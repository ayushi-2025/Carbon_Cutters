The Carbon Emission Control Project, also known as "Carbon Cutters," aims to create an interactive and user-friendly platform that helps users understand, monitor, and reduce their carbon footprint. This project leverages a web-based interface where users can calculate their emissions, complete environmental challenges, and receive actionable solutions to reduce their carbon footprint. The project will use Java for backend database management and is deployed on a cloud environment for improved accessibility, scalability, and storage capabilities.
